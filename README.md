**PyBer Analysis**

#**Overview of the analysis**
##Following the initial analysis, V. Isualize gave us two new tasks:
##1.	Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 

##2.	Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
##After completing these two tasks, we were to summarize how the data varied by city type and how any differences could inform future decisions at PyBer.

#**Results** 

## Below is a summary of the ride-sharing data across the different city types:
