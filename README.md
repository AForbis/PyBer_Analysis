# __PyBer Analysis__

# __Overview of the analysis__

Following the initial analysis, V. Isualize gave us two new tasks:

  1.	Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
  2.	Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

After completing these two tasks, we were to summarize how the data varied by city type and how any differences could inform future decisions at PyBer.

# __Results__

**Figure 1 - Ride-sharing data across city types**

**Total Rides / Total Drivers** 
  - Urban cities had significantly higher numbers of rides and drivers than suburban or rural cities.
  - Urban vs. Suburban: Urban cities had approximately 2.5x more rides and 5x more drivers than suburban cities.
  - Urban vs. Rural: Urban cities had approximately 13x more rides and 31x more drivers than rural cities.

**Total Fares** 
  - Urban cities had significantly higher total fares than than suburban or rural cities.
  - *Urban vs. Suburban*: Urban cities brought in over $20 million more in total fares than suburban cities.
  - *Urban vs. Rural*: Urban cities brought in over $35 million more in total fares than rural cities.

**Average Fare per Ride / Average Fare per Drive**
  - Rural cities had the highest average fares per ride and average fares per drive compared to suburban and urban cities.
  - *Rural vs. Suburban*: Rural cities had approximately 12% higher average fares per ride and 40% higher fares per drive than suburban cities.
  - *Rural vs. Urban*: Rural cities had approximately 41% higher average fares per ride and 235% higher fares per drive than urban cities.

**Total Fares by City Type**
  - values are range bound by about $500 in each city type
  - no city type eclipses another for any one week
  - few if any shared spikes across all 3 city types (outside of the late Feb. spike - what holiday is late Feb since that is a week or more after V-day???) 
  - trendlines by month for each...
