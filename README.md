# __PyBer Analysis__

# __Overview of the analysis__

Following the initial analysis, V. Isualize gave us two new tasks:

  1.	Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
  2.	Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

After completing these two tasks, we were to summarize how the data varied by city type and how any differences could inform future decisions at PyBer.

# __Results__

Below is a summary of the ride-sharing data across the different city types:

**Total Rides / Total Drivers**: Unsurprisingly, larger city types came with higher numbers of rides and drivers. more
